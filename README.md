# Python 75 hackathon

Criteria is below:

## 1. Regular progress, Clean Coding & Clear Documentation (Max 110 points)
Make regular progress in your Github contribution. Don't dump all the code one time. Even if you have issues in your python files, don't worry about them. Just commit them and then fix them later.

## 2. Genuine Code (no copy paste ), Clear folder structure (Max 140 points)
Don't simply copy and paste the code. If our validators come to know that you copied the code, you will get lower points.
We randomly copy your code and google them. If we find a match, you will get lower points.

As the hackathon goal is to keep 75 python files, just follow the rules. This hackathon is helping you to learn Python even though you are new to this. You can come with a proper folder structure to keep your files organized. For example for file I/O, you can say the folder name "file_io" and for string related work, you can say string_examples

## 3. Run without any errors & Code Diversity (Max 100 points)
Your code should run on Windows/Linux properly without any errors. More errors we get, less points you will get as well.
Don't simply focus on a single topic like 50 exercises on String alone. As long as you involve many topics, you will get higher points.

Remember, our goal is to let you "TASTE all flavors of Python Ice Cream". So don't simply stick with one flavor. More diversified areas you explored in Python, more marks you get.

## 4. Error Archive storage (Max 30 points)
You might be encountering errors during this Hackathon. Just create a file called error_archive_<username>.txt and store all of your errors you faced.

More we have errors, more marks for you. Don't say that you don't have any mistakes at all and you are a super code. We know that's a complete lie. Use this video to understand about Error Archive and how to store it?

## 5. Talent Accurate Profile & Project update (Max 25 points)
Just create your Talent Accurate (we call TACT) profile and update your project over there. The website is still in BETA, so if you face any issues, please let us know.

## 6. Code validation on Zoom call (Max 80 points)
We will give you a call random time (Other than your sleeping hours) to check your progress. Be available on Zoom audio call and be ready to share your screen.

Our validators might expect you to run the code in your laptop. If you are not able to run the code, you will get lower points.
Based on your progress, commitment, and other factors, our validators can give you special credits. 

## 7. Minimum one comment (peer/expert) on your project & 2 like bubbles (Max 15 points)
Make sure that you have one of your friends checked your project and commented on TACT project page. If you get minimum one comment on your project, you will get max marks. Also, make sure you get minimum 2 likes for your project.
