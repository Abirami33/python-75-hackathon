# Python 75 hackathon

Criteria is below:

## 1 : Regular progress, Clean Coding & Clear Documentation
Make regular progress in your Github contribution. Don't dump all the code one time. Even if you have issues in your python files, don't worry about them. Just commit them and then fix them later.

## 2: Genuine Code (no copy paste ), Clear folder structure
Don't simply copy and paste the code. If our validators come to know that you copied the code, you will get lower points.
We randomly copy your code and google them. If we find a match, you will get lower points.

As the hackathon goal is to keep 75 python files, just follow the rules. This hackathon is helping you to learn Python even though you are new to this. You can come with a proper folder structure to keep your files organized. For example for file I/O, you can say the folder name "file_io" and for string related work, you can say string_examples

## 3: Run without any errors & Code Diversity
Your code should run on Windows/Linux properly without any errors. More errors we get, less points you will get as well.
Don't simply focus on a single topic like 80 exercises on String alone. As long as you involve many topics, you will get higher points.

Remember, our goal is to let you "TASTE all flavors of Python Ice Cream". So don't simply stick with one flavor. More diversified areas you explored in Python, more marks you get.

## 4: Error Archive storage
You might be encountering errors during this Hackathon. Just create a file called error_archive_<username>.txt and store all of your errors you faced.

More we have errors, more marks for you. Don't say that you don't have any mistakes at all and you are a super code. We know that's a complete lie. Use this video to understand about Error Archive and how to store it?
